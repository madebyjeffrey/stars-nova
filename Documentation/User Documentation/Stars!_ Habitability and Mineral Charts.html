<h1>STARS!: Charts of habitability spread and mineral concentrations</h1>
<b>By Alan L. Kolaga</b>
<br>Last Updated on 8/1/06

<p>08/01/06: I have finally updated this web page. The following charts were created using a sample of over 100 million planets. All parameters are independent of each other with the exception of the mineral concentrations if Radiation is greater than 90mR. </p>

<p>04/04/06: Many thanks to Dogthinkers and Kelzar for showing me that my Mineral Charts were wrong. The increase in mineral concentrations only occurs in the HIGH extreme range of radiation (+40 to +49). I will have updated charts in a few days.</p>

<p>09/27/02: I have replaced the Mineral Chart with three new ones. Normal range is from 0 to ±39 clicks, Extreme range is from ±40 to ±49 clicks.</p>

<p>09/20/02: The following charts were created using a sample of 3,395,092 planets. You will notice the stair stepping on the low end of the Gravity chart. This is due to limitations of *.p1 file format. One interesting chart to look at is Mineral Concentration.</p>

<p>09/20/02: I used a tri-immune JoaT, so as to not unduly bias the sample. I also used a StarMOD to increase the planetary scanner to 4999/9999 ly range. These charts were created in Excel. I have all of my data available in a zip file. One file with all raw planetary data (56,217KB) and one file without the planetary data (34KB). If you would like a copy, please e-mail me.</p>

<br>±48 clicks from center: 0.2*(1/0.9)%
<br>±47 clicks from center: 0.3*(1/0.9)%
<br>±46 clicks from center: 0.4*(1/0.9)%
